# 🌌 Solar System Explorer

A visually stunning, interactive 3D-style visualization of our solar system, built entirely with the power of modern CSS. Experience the cosmos right from your browser! 🚀

## 🎯 Key Features

* **🎨 Pure CSS Magic** – Complex animations, orbits, and lighting effects created without relying on heavy graphics engines.
* **🪐 Interactive Navigation** – Seamlessly switch between planets (Mercury to Pluto) using the side navigation menu.
* **🌘 Detailed Orbital Systems** – Visualizes planets along with their major moons (like Io, Europa, and Ganymede for Jupiter).
* **✨ Smooth Transitions** – Elegant animations when switching between celestial bodies.
* **📱 Responsive & Immersive** – A sleek dark-themed design that looks great on various screen sizes.
* **📚 Educational Snippets** – distinct facts and descriptions for every planet.

## 🚀 How It Works

1.  **Select a Planet** – Use the left-hand navigation bar to choose a celestial body (e.g., Jupiter, Mars, Earth).
2.  **Watch the Orbit** – The system transitions to focus on the selected planet, displaying its specific orbit and moons.
3.  **Learn** – Read the dynamic description and fun facts about the planet displayed at the bottom.
4.  **Explore Moons** – Observe the detailed orbits of moons circling the planetary giants.

## 🔧 Built With

* **HTML5** – Semantic structure for the cosmos.
* **CSS3** – The core engine! Uses advanced techniques like:
    * `@keyframes` for orbital animations.
    * `gradients` for realistic planet textures and lighting.
    * `transform` (3D) for spatial positioning.
* **JavaScript (Minimal)** – Used solely for lightweight DOM manipulation (handling click events).
